This repository demonstrates an uncommon Scala code error. The error arises from implicit type assumptions when using type parameters in methods.  The `bug.scala` file shows the initial code causing the compilation failure, while `bugSolution.scala` provides a corrected version.  The issue highlights the importance of explicit type handling when using generics, especially with operations like addition that aren't universally defined.
